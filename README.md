## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

During this project, I learned to implement hover and focus states effectively. 

```css
.title:hover,
.title:focus {
  color: hsl(47, 88%, 50%);
}
```

I also learnt how to import google fonts using css.

```css
@import url("https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Figtree:wght@600;800&display=swap");

body {
  font-family: "Figtree", sans-serif;
}
```

### Continued development

I plan to continue refining my skills in creating responsive designs and enhancing user interactions with more advanced CSS features.
